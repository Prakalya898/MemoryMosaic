# MemoryMosaic

This project aims to develop a powerful and user-friendly platform for managing images. The application will have a full-stack architecture with Node.js as the backend, and will allow users to conveniently store, view, and search for their images. The UI will feature pagination for easy navigation through image collections, and the app will use a Node.js server to communicate with the React front-end via APIs.
